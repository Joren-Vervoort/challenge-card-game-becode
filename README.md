You apply for a job as a developper for an online casino called WeTakeYourMoney.

They are interested in your profile. As an interview challenge they ask you to build a card game in Python.

Must-have features
We want you to build a basis for a card game. There is not actual game being played in the must-have version. There are no points that get counted. What we want is just that a deck of cards gets created, and split between the different players and each player plays a card at every turn, until there are no cards left.

The game is working until each player doesn't have any cards left.
The game generates all the cards.
The game distributes all the cards.
Nice-to-have features
Once you have the basis of a card game, you can go ahead an make a real card game from it.

Make the game interactive, at each turn, ask to the player which card he/her wants to play.
Create gameover conditions and add the possibiliy in the game to end because of the aforementioned conditions.
Add points for each player if the card is the most powerful card played that turn.
Select a winner out of the players at the end of the game.
